# Portfolio Week 2

## User Stories

🐿️ As a user, I want the website design to adjust using media queries so that it works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens.  
🐿️ As a user with accessibility needs, I expect accessible considerations like alternative text for images so my screen reader can interpret and convey the content to me effectively.  
🐿️ As a user, I want to easily switch between images in the gallery using buttons so that my experience is smooth and intuitive.

🐿️ As a user with accessibility needs, I want ARIA elements, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes, to improve my interaction with the website.  
🐿️ As a user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts, like arrow keys, to switch between images easily.  
🐿️ As a user on various devices, I want the website to adapt to different screen sizes through the use of media queries for an optimal viewing experience.
